          <p class="small-note">Gun fires every second as a way to tell time.</p>
          <p>
            Context: This sketch uses p5.js rectangle shapes to simulate a gun firing every second and is designed
            in the context of gaming. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> The context for this design is gaming. Guns are notorius throughout
            most games these days and I chose to use a gun for this clock because they have a very rhythmic 
            nature to them through their reload and firing speed. Gamers could use this clock while they are 
            playing games or they just want a cool clock to represent them as a gamer.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Initially, I wanted the firing of the gun to represent seconds,
            the reloading of a gun to represent minutes, and upgrading to a more powerful gun to represent hours. 
            However, simply creating this rifle which is only made out of 3 shapes took a surpisingly long time so 
            I stuck with only representing seconds by creating a muzzle flash at the end of the barrel every second.
            I made the gun brown to represent a rifle, the muzzle flash yellow and orange to represent fire, and I
            also made the seconds of the clock above the gun red to represent the firing is correlated with seconds of the clock.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> I feel there are many things I could do to improve this clock such
            as kickback animations, adding more details to the gun, and showing how the bolt and magazine are reloaded.
            I also wanted to add more guns to represent hours but I that would be a very time consuming task. I could also 
            add things like sound and a target getting hit from far away.</li>

          <p class="small-note">Knight chess piece zig-zags across board to tell time.</p>
          <p>
            Context: This sketch uses p5.js rectangle shapes to simulate a chess board with a knight moving across each tile every
            second. This sketch is also designed in the context of gaming. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> The context for this design is gaming. I chose chess because it is one of the oldest games
            ever made and also becasue it is a good representation of time due to the back and forth nature of needing to make
            moves along with the fact that chess games are often timed. Gamers could use this clock as a screen saver or they could
            even use it as a clock for one of their chess games.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Initially, I wanted to find a database of 60 move chess games where
            each move would represent a second, the ending of a game could represent a minute and differet chess players
            could represent an hour. However, the logic to just move the knight across the board was difficult enough and
            finding the datasets for multiple games and then reading the moves from that data would have been quite hard to implement.
            Instead, I chose to just try and represent seconds and minutes by having the knight go to each tile count as a second
            and having the knight complete the board count as a minute (Although completing the board is 64 tiles and not 60 so this idea didn't work out so well).
            I chose to go with a black and white board for simplicity. I also added a knight with a red circle under it to make it clear
            where the knight was going. Finally, I changed the seconds on the clock to red and the minutes to green as a way to 
            show that that was the time I was measuring.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> There is a lot more that I could have done to make this a better clock. For instance,
            I could have implemented more pieces so different pieces move per second. I could have also had multiple 60
            move games to represent a minute. Finally, I could have organized the games for each hour by differtent
            famous chess players and made a key on the side to show which chess player represented which hour.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="small-note">Three cars go across a track to represent seconds, minutes, and hours.</p>
          <p>
            Context: This sketch uses p5.js rectangle and circle shapes to simulate cars circling acorss a track and is designed
            in the context of gaming. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> The context for this design is gaming. Racing games are one of the most popular
            types of games in the industry and they are easily connected with time as the purpose of racing games is to go
            as fast as possible and try to get first place. Gamers could use this clock while they are 
            playing games but this clock is also versitile as it looks extremely similar to a normal clock which means they could choose to use this 
            clock in any other context as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> This is my favorite design out of the three because the design
            decisions came so naturally when I was trying to represent time. Initially, I had a figure of 8 as a racing 
            track as I thought it would be cool but after discussing with a friend, we both agreed that simply making the track 
            into a circle would be a better decision since it would look like a clock. The other decisions I went with 
            fell into place as well. Since I wanted this clock to represent seconds, minutes, and hours I decided to give each 
            car their own lane, color, and symbol which would show which time each car represents. The colors I gave to each car 
            also macthed how fast that car would going. For instance, seconds is the fastest so I made that car red and hours is the 
            slowest so I made that car blue. Finally, I changed the colors of the clock as well so that each unit of time on the clock would 
            correlate with the unit of time of each car.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> With this design, I feel there is not too much that I could improve on. 
            I could potentially add more lanes to represent units of time like days or miliseconds but that could also be seen as extra. 
            Other small things I could fix could be stuff like making the border attach more closely with the track or giving the cars 
            more detail so they look more like cars. Lastly, I think adding celebrations sounds for each car after they pass the finish
            line could be a cool idea as well. </li>
          </ul>
